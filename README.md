## ðŸ“‹ Troubleshooting/Issues

**Sign in with Github:** While trying to loading using "Sign in with Github", if the redirect not occurred in the first click, try a second one. Due to the **callback returned from the Github API**, the loading sometimes is not being caught, and not showing any output. Trying a second click almost always solves and Sign in using Github successfully. It's a situation that needs to be handled with more time to analyze the reason why it's happening.

**Use of External Web Service:** in orther to surpass a problem related to CORS policy the app is connected to an **heroku web service** that make a **bridge** between this react web app and the github OAuth services, in order to allow the user to Sign in using Github account

**CSS External Files:** applying an external "".css", was not recognized by the application. Returning an error related to the webpack. An issue that did not have time to analyze more careflly the reasons.
* Module parse failed: Unexpected token (1:0)
